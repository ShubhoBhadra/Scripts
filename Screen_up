//Every 60 seconds, this script toggles the NumLock key twice, effectively leaving it in the same state it started in.
//It simulate keyboard activity to prevent the system from going idle, locking, or sleeping.
//By toggling the NumLock twice, it changes and restores its state quickly, so the user doesn't notice a change.

//This script is often used to:
  //Prevent screen savers or system sleep.
  //Keep a session "active" on a remote desktop or terminal.
  //Avoid idle timeouts for apps or logins.

//NOTE: save this script always with .vbs extension eg. always_screen_up.vbs
